![Ola Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af6b715c-bd9b-45f1-be7c-ebdd0397f94e)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Ola's ride data using Python for data cleaning and business analysis, and Tableau for visualization. The goal is to extract valuable insights into customer behavior, ride trends, pricing patterns, and operational efficiency. <br><br>

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw Ola ride data using Python.
- Analyze key business metrics such as revenue, ride demand, and customer retention.
- Identify trends in peak ride hours, pricing, and driver efficiency.
- Visualize data using Tableau to create an interactive dashboard.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to optimize Olaâ€™s services.
<br><br>


## Project Level: Beginner
This project is a beginners level project.To get me familiar with the basics of Python and Tableau and to gain knowledge on how to handle real-world data analysis problems. I have worked with a small dataset and had used python libraries and Tableau to solve different tasks that are commonly encountered in data analytics.<br><br>


## Dataset Information

- The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated using ChatGPT.
- It simulates real-world Ola ride data, including features like ride time, distance, fare, driver ratings, and customer details.
- This dataset is used for learning and analysis purposes only and does not represent actual Ola data.<br><br>

## Dataset Availability

- The dataset is included in this repository as `cleaned_dataset.zip`
- You can download it from the folder.<br><br>

## Project Workflow

#### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation (Python) -<br>
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.<br>
- Standardized date-time formats and ride status.<br>
- Performed feature engineering to extract insights.<br>

#### 2. Business Problem Solving (Python) -<br>
- Analyzed ride frequency, demand trends, and pricing.<br>
- Identified peak ride hours and surge pricing patterns.<br>
- Evaluated driver performance and trip efficiency.<br>
- Assessed customer retention and ride preferences.<br>

#### 3. Documentation of business problems -<br>
- Presented all business problems in a docx file.<br>
- Findings and insights.<br>

#### 4. Dashboard planning -<br>
- Planned dashboard using Excalidraw.<br>
  
#### 5. Data Visualization & Dashboard (Tableau) -<br>
- Imported cleaned Python data into Tableau.<br>
- Tableau Dashboard for insights.(5 Pages)<br><br>
